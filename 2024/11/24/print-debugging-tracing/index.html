For me, a better tool is OpenTelemetry tracing; it gives me high granularity, parent-child relationships between operations, timings, and is filterable and searchable. I can also use it to debug remote issues, as long as the user can send me a file.\nPrint Debugging The good thing about print debugging is that it is always available; it is very rare a process doesn’t have a stdout (or stderr) available, or some kind of logging system. The downside with print debugging is that it is very basic; anything more you want to do with it, such as timing data, has to be implemented.\nOne of the comments I read was, in essence:\none place print debugging is best is dealing with threading/timing bugs, it lets you see what is happening when\nI can understand this, but often print statements are buffered before hitting the terminal, so you might lose some order; you can solve that with a timestamp (assuming it’s accurate enough), but as I mentioned earlier, you need to do that yourself.\nUse a Debugger? The first debugger I used was in Visual Studio, and it was amazing. I learned how to use a lot of features in it, such as automatic break-on-exception, conditional breakpoints, automatic counters (“break after hitting this line x times”), watches, and computed values. This was at the beginning of my career, and neither I, nor the codebase, knew anything of automated testing.\nOnce I learned about automated testing, and then started writing tests, the amount of time I used the debugger reduced. It was still a great tool, but tests were sometimes the quicker way to verify some behaviour. Often times, once I had investigated a problem with the debugger, I would write a test to cover that situation - now the repeated debugger usage to know if the fix worked wasn’t needed.\nI don’t often use a debugger these days. It still has it’s place in my toolkit, but in general, I lean more on OpenTelemetry and tracing in general.\nTracing My current go-to tool for debugging and application development is OpenTelemetry tracing. I’ve written about why I prefer tracing to Structured Logging before, but this is a bit different.\nBy default, tracing lets me see the relationships between function calls, the timing durations of each span (a span is a unit of execution; it could be a function call or a call into a library), and many structured attributes (both automatic and manually added.)\nThe downside is that you need some way to view that tracing data; using the stdout trace exporter is generally not useful - its far too noisy. For local development I use Grafana Tempo all-in-one, or Otel-TUI. For deployed environments, I still think honeycomb is the best placec for traces.\nMost projects I interact with have a docker-compose file for all their local dependencies; adding a tracing viewer to that compose file is pretty trival, so the barrier to entry is really not that high:\ngrafana: image: grafana/otel-lgtm ports: - \"3000:3000\" - \"4317:4317\" Tracing for Remote Debugging I maintain some internal CLI applications, which make extensive use of tracing. When a user has a problem, they can add a --store-traces flag to the CLI, and it will write all the tracing data for their run to a file on disk. They can then send me that file, I can load it into a trace viewer, and use all the high-cardinality attributes and timing data to figure out where their problem is exactly.\nDo you ever use print debugging? Not often, but it does happen sometimes. As I said at the outset; its just a tool, and I can and do use it. I just happen to prefer a different tool.\n","wordCount":"656","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://andydote.co.uk/2024/11/24/print-debugging-tracing/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Andy Dote","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://andydote.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://andydote.co.uk accesskey=h title="Andy Dote (Alt + H)">Andy Dote</a>
