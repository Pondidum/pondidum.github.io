The only thing I had done was restart the machine, and now things were breaking.\nThe Symptoms A docker container started inside the guest VMs with a port mapped to the machine’s public IP wasn’t resolvable outside the host.\nFor example, using a machine based off the bento/ubuntu-16.04 base box, provisioned with docker, running this from inside an SSH connection to the machine would work:\nvagrant ssh # launch a container which can respond to a http get docker run -d --rm -p 172.127.48.105:5000:5000 registry:latest # curl by public ip curl http://172.127.48.105:5000 --silent -w \"%{http_code}\" # 200 But running the same curl command on the host would fail:\n# container is still running curl http://172.127.48.105:5000 --silent -w \"%{http_code}\" # timeout Investigation So it’s 5 hours before the demo (thankfully it’s not 10 minutes before), so let’s start digging into what could be causing this.\nDocker Networking I also was searching for Nomad and Docker networking issues - as I figured I could change the Nomad job to bind the container to all interfaces (e.g. -p 5000:5000) instead of just the one IP. This reply mentioned the docker0 network, and when I checked the guest machines, I saw that this network is also in the 172.* range.\nSo my guest machines had public addresses which happened to fall in the same range as a separate network adaptor on that machine.\nHyper-V IP Addresses While I was checking the Windows Firewall to see if anything was weird in there, I stumbled across a rule I’d added to allow exposure of a NodeJS service from my host to Hyper-v guests (but not anywhere else). I noticed that the IP range it defined was 192.168.*, and I now had machines with 172.* addresses.\nSo the IP address range for guest machines had changed.\nThe Solution Luckily, there is a straightforward solution to this:\nReboot until you get the range you want\nReally.\nThe other solution is to use an External Switch in Hyper-V and bridge it with your host’s internet connection, which doesn’t really help me, as I am on a laptop, on different WiFi networks, and sometimes I use a thunderbolt based network adaptor too. And having to update/rebuild machines on every network change would be an absolute pain.\nSo I rebooted — a lot.\nSo if anyone from Microsoft is reading this: Please let us configure the Default Switch. Or have a way to recreate it without rebooting at least.\n","wordCount":"451","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2019-03-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2019-03-22T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://andydote.co.uk/2019/03/22/hyperv-networking/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Andy Dote","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://andydote.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://andydote.co.uk accesskey=h title="Andy Dote (Alt + H)">Andy Dote</a>
