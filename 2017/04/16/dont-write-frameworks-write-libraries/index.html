Not only is there either too little or too much configuration options, but how the configuration is done can cause issues. Some developers love conventions, other prefer explicit configuration.\nDevelopment Frameworks suffer from the danger of not solving the right problem, or missing the problem due to how long it took to implement the framework. This is compounded by when a framework is decided to be developed, which is often way before the general case is even recognised. Writing a framework before writing your project is almost certain to end up with a framework which either isn’t suitable for the project, or isn’t suitable for any other projects.\nWhat about a library or two? If you want a higher chance at success, reduce your scope and write a library.\nA library is usually a small unit of functionality, and does one thing and does it well (sound like microservices or Bounded Contexts much?). This gives it a higher chance of success, as the opinions of the library are going to effect smaller portions of peoples applications. It won’t dictate their entire app structure. They can opt in to using the libraries they like, rather than all the baggage which comes with a framework.\nBut I really want to write a framework Resist, if you can! Perhaps a framework will evolve from your software, perhaps not. What I have found to be a better path is to create libraries which work on their own, but also work well with each other. This can make this more difficult, but it also give you the ability to release libraries as they are completed, rather than waiting for an entire framework to be “done”.\nSome examples These are some libraries I have written which solve small problems in an isolated manner\nStronk - A library to populate strong typed configuration objects. FileSystem - Provides a FileSystem abstraction, with decorators and an InMemory FileSystem implementation. Finite - a Finite State Machine library.
