+++

The Visual Studio Find and Replace dialog is often overlooked, and when parts of it are looked at (Regex searching) it often gets a bad rep.  Sure it doesn't implement all of the Regex syntax (non greedy search springs to mind), but that's not to say it isn't useful.

For instance, I was working on some code that involved a Model View Presenter type style, but used Subroutines (void methods) rather than WriteOnly properties for brevity (in C# you can do a Set only property in 1 line, VB it takes 5).  As the View is doing nothing other than assigning labels from these "Setters" who cares how many lines it takes?

A quick breakdown of the parts of the expressions used:

	Finding:
	{}		//Tag an expression, used in replacements.  Numbered sequentially from 1, not 0.
	(.*)	//Any character, any number of times, as many as possible.
	\		//escape character, allows us to search for a literal '.' or other Regex used symbol.

	Replacing:
	\1		//The content of a tagged expression.
	\n		//New line
	\t		//Tab (although after running all these find and replaces, a quick {CTRL+E, CTRL+D} (format document) does most of the tidying for you).

So we start with the Interface:

```vb
Public Interface IProcessDetailsView
	Sub FileID(ByVal value As Integer)
	Sub SubmittedBy(ByVal value As String)
	Sub ReceivedDate(ByVal value As DateTime)
	//...
End Interface
```

So in the find and replace dialog I enter the following:

	Find what:
	Sub {(.*)}\(ByVal value As {(.*)}\)

	Replace with:
	WriteOnly Property \1() As \2

The interface definition now changes to this:

```vb
Public Interface IProcessDetailsView
	WriteOnly Property FileID() As Integer
	WriteOnly Property SubmittedBy() As String
	WriteOnly Property ReceivedDate() As DateTime
	//...
End Interface
```

Not too difficult right?  Good. Now onto the View's methods:

```vb
Public Class ProcessDetails
	Implements IProcessDetailsView

	Public Sub FileID(ByVal value As Integer) Implements IProcessDetailsView.FileID
		lblFileID.Text = value.ToString
	End Sub

	Public Sub SubmittedBy(ByVal value As String) Implements IProcessDetailsView.SubmittedBy
		lblAccountName.Text = value
	End Sub

	//...
End Class
```

Into the find and replace dialog:

	Find what:
	Public Sub {(.*)}\(ByVal value As {(.*)}\) Implements IProcessDetailsView\.(.*)

	Replace with:
	Public WriteOnly Property \1() As \2 Implements IProcessDetailsView.\1\n\t\tSet(ByVal value As \2)

	Find what:
	End Sub

	Replace with:
	End Set\n\tEnd Property

You could do this with one expression, although I have found its far less hassle to use two find and replace runs rather than trying to find new lines etc

```vb
Public Class ProcessDetails
	Implements IProcessDetailsView

	Public WriteOnly Property FileID() As Integer Implements IProcessDetailsView.FileID
		Set(ByVal value As Integer)
			lblFileID.Text = value.ToString
		End Set
	End Property

	Public WriteOnly Property SubmittedBy() As String Implements IProcessDetailsView.SubmittedBy
		Set(ByVal value As String)
			lblAccountName.Text = value
		End Set
	End Property

End Class
```

Now the main reason for this change was the presenter code, which doesn't sit right with me.  At a glance, am I expecting something to be calculated or what?

```vb
Public Sub Display(ByVal processHistory As ICVProcessHistory)
	_view.FileID(processHistory.FileID)
	_view.SubmittedBy(processHistory.AccountName)
	//...
End Sub
```

Find and replace dialog again:

	Find what:
	\_view\.{(.*)}\({(.*)}\.{(.*)}\)

	Replace with:
	_view.\1 = \2.\3

Which gives us this:

```vb
Public Sub Display(ByVal processHistory As ICVProcessHistory)
	_view.FileID = processHistory.FileID
	_view.SubmittedBy = processHistory.AccountName
	//...
End Sub
```

Much better in my opinion.
