I’m usually pretty easy to get hold of, here’s how I use different channels to communicate with people and how best to contact me.

## Email
This is the easiest way to contact me.  I'll usually respond quickly. The address is [andy@andydote.co.uk](mailto:andy@andydote.co.uk).

## Twitter
My DMs are usually open, and I will usually respond.  I tend to announce anything interesting I'm going to be doing on Twitter, so follow if you can.  My handle is [@pondidum](https://twitter.com/pondidum).

## Twitch & YouTube
I used to stream a lot of software development but had to stop as I just didn't get enough downtime, and something had to give.  I might start again on a much lighter schedule at some point in the future.  It'll be announced on Twitter if I do.  My [channel is Pondidum](https://www.twitch.tv/pondidum).  There is a YouTube channel with [all my past streams](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsE6VIFVuJjBowVo49fLchQ) too.

## LinkedIn
I don't have a LinkedIn account, and I have no intention of getting one.  If you find me on LinkedIn, it's not actually me.

## Skype
I only log into Skype when something is arranged for it.  Email me, and we can work out if Skype is the right medium to communicate.

## What I will respond to
Enquiries about speaking at events will always get a response, even if I have to decline.

My rough rules for speaking at events, which are not set in stone are as follows.  All assume I am available on a given date:

* **Local (In Finland)** - I'll gladly come and speak
* **Non-Profit/Community (abroad)** - Depends on how interesting the location/event looks to me
* **For-Profit/Corporate (abroad)** - Cover my Hotel & Travel Expenses


## What I might respond to

I do not do tech-support unless we have a commercial agreement in place.  If it's an issue with a library I maintain, a Github Issue is your best bet.

If your message doesn’t explicitly look like it needs a response or it’s vague or not clear what the purpose is, you may not hear back from me.
