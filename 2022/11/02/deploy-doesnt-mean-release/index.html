A build process can consist of testing, linting, compilation, transpilation, or any other number of steps.\nArtefact An artefact is the result of the build. It has a version, and can be deployed to an environment. An artefact can contain many features which can be uniquely controlled.\nIt should also have metadata embedded in it to link it back to the build which produced it and also to the source it was built from.\nIf a build is producing multiple different versioned artefacts, having a way to link them all to the same process is important.\nVersion A version is an identifier which uniquely labels an artefact. This can be a chosen format such as SemVer, a datestamp, or a commit hash. It could also be an auto-incrementing build counter.\nDeploy The process of getting an artifact into an environment. Doesn’t necessarily cause any visible changes to a user or client of the application.\nEnvironment A location running the application. An environment may have multiple applications running, making up one complete product.\nRelease Release is switching on (or off) a feature to users, independent of deploy. This is usually done with Feature Flags, and can mean releasing to all users, or just a subset (either a random sample or specific users.)\nYou can also automate feature rollout by combining it with your observability data, rolling out to more users over time if, for example, error rates don’t increase.\n","wordCount":"381","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://andydote.co.uk/2022/11/02/deploy-doesnt-mean-release/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Andy Dote","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://andydote.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://andydote.co.uk accesskey=h title="Andy Dote (Alt + H)">Andy Dote</a>
