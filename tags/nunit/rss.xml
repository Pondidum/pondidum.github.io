Having used Shouldly in anger for a long time, I have to say I feel a little hamstrung when going back to just using NUnit&amp;rsquo;s assertions.
I have been known on a couple of projects which use only NUnit assertions, when trying to solve a test failure with array differences, to install Shouldly, fix the test, then remove Shouldly again!</description></item></channel></rss>
