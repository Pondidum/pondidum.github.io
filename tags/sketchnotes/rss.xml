I enjoyed it a lot, and once the video came out, I rewatched it, and decided to have a go at doing a “sketchnotes”, which I shared on Twitter, which people liked!
I’ve never done one before, but it was pretty fun. I made it in OneNote, zoomed out a lot, and took a screenshot.</description></item></channel></rss>
