So let&amp;rsquo;s kick things off with a nice statement:
I hate broken builds.
So everyone basically agrees on this point I think. The problem is that I mean all builds, including ones on shared feature branches.
Currently, I work on a number of projects which uses small(ish) feature branches. The way this works is that the team agrees on a new feature to work on creates a branch, and then each developer works on tasks, committing on their own branches, and Pull-Requesting to the feature branch.</description></item></channel></rss>
