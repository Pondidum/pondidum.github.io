Like most people, I have done this using a fenced codeblock in markdown which is fine for short blocks of code.
The problem occours when I am embedding code from another repository; often there will be tweaks or bug fixes, and keeping the code in the blog post in sync with the code in the other repo is annoying and manual.</description></item><item><title>Writing Conference Talks</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/05/15/writing-conference-talks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/05/15/writing-conference-talks/</guid><description>I saw an interesting question on twitter today:
Hey, people who talk at things: How long does it take you to put a new talk together?
I need like 50 hours over at least a couple of months to make something I don&amp;rsquo;t hate. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get that down (maybe by not doing pictures?) but wondering what&amp;rsquo;s normal for everyone else.

I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it takes me to write a talk - as it is usually spread over many weeks/months, worked on as and when I have inspiration.</description></item></channel></rss>
