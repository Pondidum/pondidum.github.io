Hey, people who talk at things: How long does it take you to put a new talk together?
I need like 50 hours over at least a couple of months to make something I don&amp;rsquo;t hate. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get that down (maybe by not doing pictures?) but wondering what&amp;rsquo;s normal for everyone else.

I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it takes me to write a talk - as it is usually spread over many weeks/months, worked on as and when I have inspiration.</description></item></channel></rss>
