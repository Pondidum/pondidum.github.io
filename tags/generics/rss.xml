Public Event FilterStart(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) &amp;#39;... Private Delegate Sub OnFilterCompleteDelegate(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As FilterCompleteEventArgs) &amp;#39;... Private Sub OnFilterComplete(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As DataAccess.LoadEventArgs) If _parent.InvokeRequired Then _parent.Invoke(new OnFilterCompleteDelegate(AddressOf OnFilterComplete), new Object() {sender, e}) Else RaiseEvent FullResultsStart(sender, e) End If End Sub &amp;#39;.</description></item></channel></rss>
