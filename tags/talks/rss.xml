Hey, people who talk at things: How long does it take you to put a new talk together?
I need like 50 hours over at least a couple of months to make something I don&amp;rsquo;t hate. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get that down (maybe by not doing pictures?) but wondering what&amp;rsquo;s normal for everyone else.

I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it takes me to write a talk - as it is usually spread over many weeks/months, worked on as and when I have inspiration.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw an interesting question on twitter today:</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it takes me to write a talk - as it is usually spread over many weeks/months, worked on as and when I have inspiration.  The actual processes is something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Think it through</p>
<p>The start of this is usually with an idea for a subject I like a lot, such as Strong Typing, Feature Toggles, or Trunk Based Development.  Where I live I walk everywhere (around 15k to 20k steps per day), which gives me a lot of time to think about things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Giant markdown file of bullet points which I might want to cover</p>
<p>I write down all the points that I want to talk about into one markdown file, which I add to over time.  I use the github checkbox markdown format (<code>* [ ] some point or other</code>) so I can tick thinks off later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rough order of points at the bottom</p>
<p>At the bottom of this notes file, I start writing an order of things, just to get a sense of flow.  Once this order gets comfortable enough, I stop updating it and start using the real slides file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start slides writing sections as I feel like it</p>
<p>I start with the title slide, and finding a suitable large image for it.  This takes way longer than you might imagine!  For the rest of the slides, I use a mix of titles, text and hand drawn images.</p>
<p>I use OneNote and Gimp to do the hand drawn parts, and usually the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/icons/">Google Cloud Platform Icons</a>, as they&rsquo;re the best looking (sorry Amazon!)</p>
<p>Attribute all the images as you go.  Much easier than trying to do it later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-order it all!</p>
<p>I talk bits of the presentation through in my head, and shuffle bits around as I see fit.  This happens a lot as I write the slides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk it through to a wall</p>
<p>My wall gets me talking to it a lot.  I talk it through outloud, and make note of stumbling points, and how long the talk takes, adding speaker notes if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tweaks and re-ordering</p>
<p>I usually end up making last minute tweaks and order switches as I figure out how to make something flow better.  I am still not happy with some transitions in my best talks yet!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I write all my talks using <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js">RevealJS</a>, mostly because I can write my slides as a markdown file and have it rendered in the browser, and partly because I&rsquo;ve always used it.</p>
<p>To get things like the Speaker Notes view working, you need to be running from a webserver (rather than just from an html file on your filesystem.)  For this I use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nws">NWS</a>, which is a static webserver for your current working directory (e.g. <code>cd /d/dev/presentations &amp;&amp; nws</code>).</p>
<p>Currently, I am trying to work out if I can use Jekyll or Hugo to generate the repository for me, as all the presentations have the same content, other than images, slides file, and a customise.css file.  Still not sure on how best to achieve what I am after though.</p>
<p>You can see the source for all my talks in my <a href="https://github.com/pondidum/presentations">Presentations Repository</a> on github.  The actual slides can be seen on my website <a href="https://andydote.co.uk/presentations/">here</a>, and the videos (if available), I link to <a href="https://andydote.co.uk/talks/">here</a>.</p>
