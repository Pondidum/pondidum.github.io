While Vault has a lot of data available in Prometheus telemetry, the kind of information I am after is best taken from the Audit backend.</description></item><item><title>Getting NodeJS OpenTelemetry data into NewRelic</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2021/03/12/nodejs-opentelemetry-newrelic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2021/03/12/nodejs-opentelemetry-newrelic/</guid><description>I had the need to get some OpenTelemetry data out of a NodeJS application, and into NewRelic&amp;rsquo;s distributed tracing service, but found that there is no way to do it directly, and in this use case, adding a separate collector is more hassle than it&amp;rsquo;s worth.

To use it was relatively straight forward:</description></item></channel></rss>
