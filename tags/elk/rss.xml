Outlined below is how I started to add observability to an existing codebase which already had the ELK stack available, and was unable to use Honeycomb. My hope, in this case, is that I can demonstrate how much value observability gives, and also show how much more value you would get with an excellent tool, such as Honeycomb.</description></item></channel></rss>
