Ideally, each toggle gets checked in as few places as possible - preferably only one place. The advantage of doing this is that very little of your codebase needs to be coupled to the toggles (either the toggle itself or the library/system for managing toggles itself).</description></item><item><title>Feature Toggles: Branch by Abstraction</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2019/06/03/feature-toggles-branch-by-abstraction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2019/06/03/feature-toggles-branch-by-abstraction/</guid><description>Recently, I was asked if I could provide an example of Branch By Abstraction when dealing with feature toggles. As this has come up a few times, I thought a blog post would be a good idea so I can refer others to it later too.
The Context As usual, this is some kind of backend (micro)service, and it will send email messages somehow. We will start with two implementations of message sending: the &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; version; which is synchronous, and a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; version; which is async.</description></item><item><title>Feature Toggles with Consul</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/09/06/consul-feature-toggles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/09/06/consul-feature-toggles/</guid><description>Feature Toggles are a great way of helping to deliver working software, although there are a few things which could go wrong. See my talk Feature Toggles: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly for some interesting stories and insights on it!
I was talking with a colleague the other day about how you could go about implementing Feature Toggles in a centralised manner into an existing system, preferably with a little overhead as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
