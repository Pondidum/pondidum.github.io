For example, I have a CLI, that creates a cluster of machines for a user; the machines use IAM Authentication with Vault so that they can request certificates on boot. The trouble with this application is that it is slow; it takes 175 seconds on average to provision the machines, write the IAM information to Vault, and then re-run the cloud-init script on all the machines in the cluster (as when they first booted, the configuration hadn&amp;rsquo;t been written to Vault yet.</description></item><item><title>Adding Observability to Vault</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2021/05/27/vault-observe/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2021/05/27/vault-observe/</guid><description>One of the things I like to do when setting up a Vault cluster is to visualise all the operations Vault is performing, which helps see usage patterns changing, whether there are lots of failed requests coming in, and what endpoints are receiving the most traffic.
While Vault has a lot of data available in Prometheus telemetry, the kind of information I am after is best taken from the Audit backend.</description></item><item><title>Observability with Infrastructure as Code</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2021/03/01/observability-with-infrastructure-as-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2021/03/01/observability-with-infrastructure-as-code/</guid><description>This article was originally published on the Pulumi blog.
When using the Pulumi Automation API to create applications which can provision infrastructure, it is very handy to be able to use observability techniques to ensure the application functions correctly and to help see where performance bottlenecks are.
One of the applications I work on creates a VPC and Bastion host and then stores the credentials into a Vault instance. The problem is that the “create infrastructure” part is an opaque blob, in that I can see it takes 129 seconds to create, but I can’t see what it’s doing, or why it takes this amount of time.</description></item><item><title>Observability Without Honeycomb</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2020/03/15/observability-without-honeycomb/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2020/03/15/observability-without-honeycomb/</guid><description>Before I start on this, I want to make it clear that if you can buy Honeycomb, you should. Outlined below is how I started to add observability to an existing codebase which already had the ELK stack available, and was unable to use Honeycomb. My hope, in this case, is that I can demonstrate how much value observability gives, and also show how much more value you would get with an excellent tool, such as Honeycomb.</description></item></channel></rss>
