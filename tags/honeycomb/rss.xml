While Vault has a lot of data available in Prometheus telemetry, the kind of information I am after is best taken from the Audit backend.</description></item><item><title>Observability with Infrastructure as Code</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2021/03/01/observability-with-infrastructure-as-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2021/03/01/observability-with-infrastructure-as-code/</guid><description>This article was originally published on the Pulumi blog.
When using the Pulumi Automation API to create applications which can provision infrastructure, it is very handy to be able to use observability techniques to ensure the application functions correctly and to help see where performance bottlenecks are.
One of the applications I work on creates a VPC and Bastion host and then stores the credentials into a Vault instance.</description></item><item><title>Observability Without Honeycomb</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2020/03/15/observability-without-honeycomb/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2020/03/15/observability-without-honeycomb/</guid><description>Before I start on this, I want to make it clear that if you can buy Honeycomb, you should. Outlined below is how I started to add observability to an existing codebase which already had the ELK stack available, and was unable to use Honeycomb. My hope, in this case, is that I can demonstrate how much value observability gives, and also show how much more value you would get with an excellent tool, such as Honeycomb.</description></item></channel></rss>
