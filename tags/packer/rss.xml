There are many kinds of tests we can write for our infrastructure, but they should all be focused on the machine/service and maybe it&amp;rsquo;s nearest dependencies, not the entire system.
While this post focuses on testing a full machine (both locally in a VM, and remotely as an Amazon EC2 instance), it is also possible to do most of the same kind of tests against a Docker container.</description></item></channel></rss>
