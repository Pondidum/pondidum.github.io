An example of this is the design of a system which stores data about people, specifically for this, their email addresses. A cut down version of the structure is this:
table people id serial primary key firstname varchar(50) lastname varchar(50) table emails id serial primary key person_id int =&amp;gt; people.</description></item></channel></rss>
