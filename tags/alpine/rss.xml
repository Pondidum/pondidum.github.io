Please see this post for an updated version which works!
Following on from the post the other day on setting up DNS forwarding to Consul with SystemD, I wanted also to show how to get Consul up and running under Alpine Linux, as it&amp;rsquo;s a little more awkward in some respects.
To start with, I am going to setup Consul as a service - I didn&amp;rsquo;t do this in the Ubuntu version, as there are plenty of useful articles about that already, but that is not the case with Alpine.</description></item></channel></rss>
