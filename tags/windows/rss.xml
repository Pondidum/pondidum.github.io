I also heavily use the git bash terminal on windows to work.
Usually, everything works as expected, but I was recently trying to run an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) container, and needed to pass in an extra configuration file for Logstash. This caused me a lot of trouble, as nothing was working as expected.</description></item></channel></rss>
