In this case, intermittent means around once in 6 months or so.  A little background to the problem first:</p>
<p>Our data access is done via what was originally Microsoft&rsquo;s SQLHelper class, passing in a stored procedure (and parameters), and our entities use the reader to load all their properties.  Pretty straight forward stuff.</p>
<p>The problemis, on the live system, every few months a sproc will stop returning results, for no apparent reason.  Calling the sproc from Sql Management Studio works fine.  We have tried many different fixes: re-applying the sproc, calling the sproc from a different database login, re-pointing to the dev or test systems.  None of it makes any difference, and then as suddenly as it stopped working, it starts working again.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was attempting to track down some inconsistent search results, this time based around an fts index.  Now this index is pretty large (at least, in my books it is) at around 1.5 million rows, and the column itself being a good few thousand words on average.</p>
<p>The code used for this problem boils down to the following</p>
<p>Sproc &ldquo;ftsSearch&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="display:flex;"><span>	<span style="color:#66d9ef">Select</span>	id

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Calling this function while the error is occurring, yields the following results:</p>
<pre><code>Query:						Results:
&quot;Project Management&quot;		20,000
&quot;Project Manager&quot;			15,000
&quot;Project Manage*&quot;			0
</code></pre>
<p>The first two queries are fine, the last however I would expect to bring back between 20,000 and ~35,000 results, and when we ran the sql from Management Studio, it brought back 29,000 results.</p>
<p>Now when debugging the function, we double checked everything was being called correctly - correct DB, correct sproc, correct login, correct (parsed) parameter.</p>
<p>Inspecting HasRows returns False.  So we forced a call to Read() anyway, just to see what happened.  An what do you know? Results, all there.</p>
<p>The reason that HasRows was returning false was that the sproc was triggering sql server to also send back a warning - in this case one about too many results (afraid I have lost the exact error code).  Sadly this behaviour does not seem to be documented anywhere.</p>

It has a single <code>HistoryItem</code> object, which is fairly straightforward, something like this:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This was populated into a <code>List&lt;HistoryItem&gt;</code> and bound to the <code>DataGridView</code> directly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>	dgvHistory.DataSource = ScreenEntity.History.ToList();
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This exposes something interesting about how the DataGridView picks column order: It&rsquo;s not done by Alphabetical Order; it is done by Definition Order.  So the order in which the properties in the class are defined is the order that the grid view will display. Usually.</p>
<p>When the piece of software was deployed (in house software, to be used by about 10 people), one user requested the order of the columns be changed.  She didn&rsquo;t like the fact that the order was this for her: <code>Note, ID, CreateDate, Creator</code>.</p>
<p>After checking my copy of the software and several other users&rsquo; copies, it turned out the order was only different on her machine.  She could login to another machine and it would be fine.  At the time I never got to the bottom of why it was setting the wrong order, but fixed it by manually specifying the column order after binding.</p>
<p>Yesterday however I was reading an article by <a href="http://www.abhisheksur.com/2010/10/hidden-facts-on-c-constructor-in.html">Abhishek Sur on the Hidden Facts of C# Structures in terms of MSIL</a> and noticed this piece of information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DemoClass is declared as auto&hellip;Auto allows the loader to change the layout of the class which it sees fit. That means the order of the members will not be kept intact while the object is created. It is also going to ignore any layout information for the class mentioned explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now while I am unable to reproduce this problem currently as I am not near work, I do wonder if the reason column orders were fine on most machines was because the CLR was keeping the properties in definition order, with the exception of one machine, where for whatever reason it was reordering the properties.</p>
<p>If this problem arises again then I will have a go at fixing it by changing to a Structure (which by default are declared as Sequential in IL) and see if that fixes the problem.</p>

It&rsquo;s one of those things that everyone wants, you know, stuff that &lsquo;just works&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s nice when companies go out of their way to make things &lsquo;just work&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s a shame Sony (and others, but I have a Sony, so it&rsquo;s their fault for this exercise) decided to make things harder for me.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain.  I have a Sony Vaio (VGN-FE21M), which has an Alps touch pad, which like all touch pad has tapping enabled by default, and that I switch off straight away.  I also have a Microsoft Intellimouse 4, which has smooth scrolling, and scroll acceleration.</p>
<p>Now despite the fact that these two settings are completely unrelated, you can&rsquo;t have both at the same time.  The problem is that if I have the touch pad driver installed, it&rsquo;s scrolling setting overwrites the intellimouse&rsquo;s scroll setting, but I need the touchpad driver to disable tapping.</p>
<p>I tried the Vista drivers for both mice; I tried the XP drivers for both.  I even tried combinations of the drivers, and drivers for the touchpad from IBM and Siemens.  None worked.  I messed around in the registry with settings, broke lots of stuff, which also didn&rsquo;t help (luckily I did a registry backup before I started&hellip;)</p>
<p>Eventually I discovered the &rsquo;latest&rsquo; drivers from Sony, IBM, Fujitsu and Siemens were not as new as they could be.  The Dell drivers which I (eventually) found were newer, and although not designed for my laptop worked a charm.  I now have a tap free track pad, and smooth scrolling.</p>
<p>If anyone else is having this problem, here  is a link to the Dell drivers: <a href="http://support.us.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;releaseid=R140031&amp;formatcnt=1&amp;libid=0&amp;fileid=187207">32 Bit Vista</a>, <a href="http://support.us.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;releaseid=R140029&amp;formatcnt=1&amp;libid=0&amp;fileid=187206">64 Bit Vista</a>.</p>

<p>In fact the first thing I did when I had the laptop new was to wipe MCE 2005 off it, and install XP Pro.  Now I have nothing against MCE, but there is no point on this laptop; there is no remote, no tuner, and the screen is only 15.1 inches (wide screen), so I couldn&rsquo;t see the point in all the extra paraphernalia that MCE needs running in the background.</p>
<p>When I installed all the Vaio stuff on XP, it all worked fine, as it did in Vista too. Sort of.  While the hot keys worked (brightness was the only one I was really interested in), it sapped 50% CPU <em>all the time</em>.  This was worrying, as I have a dual core, and thus if I had single core, it would be using 100% all the time.  Not good.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, I installed the XP version of the Event Service (Version 2.3.00.08110) instead of the Vista version (Version 3.0.00.13110), which solved the problem, and worked 100%.</p>
<p>Now while I am please it works, it begs the question; if it aint broke, why &lsquo;fix&rsquo; it?.  So anyone who&rsquo;s hot keys don&rsquo;t work in Vista, or do work, but slow Vista down (more), just install the XP Versions!</p>

If you have a FlowLayoutPanel on your form, and have many items in it, causing it to overflow and require scroll bars, you are unable to scroll the control&rsquo;s content using the mouse wheel.</p>
<p>This is somewhat trying in today&rsquo;s applications, as nearly everyone has a mouse with a scroll wheel, or a track pad on their laptop with a scroll area.</p>
<p>I came across the solution to the problem at Scott Waldron&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.thewayofcoding.com/2008/02/c-net-programming-tip-flowlayoutpanel.html">blog</a>, where he adds code to the Flow Layout Panel&rsquo;s MouseEnter Event that focuses the Flow Layout Panel, and thus allows it to be scrolled with the wheel.  Many thanks to him for finding the solution and blogging about it.</p>
<p>My real bone of contention with this is that the Flow Layout Panel does not support this behaviour by default.  If it is a feature not everyone wants, just put a Boolean property on the control called &ldquo;Accepts Scroll Wheel&rdquo; or something similar, and have it False by default.</p>
