The problem is that the Consul cluster needs Vault to create the certificates for TLS, which is quite the catch-22. Luckily for us, quite easy to solve:
Start a temporary Vault instance as an intermediate ca Launch Consul cluster, using Vault to generate certificates Destroy temporary Vault instance Start a permanent Vault instance, with Consul as the store Reprovision the Consul cluster with certificates from the new Vault instance There is a repository on Github with all the scripts used, and a few more details on some options.</description></item><item><title>Creating a TLS enabled Consul cluster</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2019/09/14/consul-tls-cluster/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2019/09/14/consul-tls-cluster/</guid><description>This post is going to go through how to set up a Consul cluster to communicate over TLS. I will be using Vagrant to create three machines locally, which will form my cluster, and in the provisioning step will use Vault to generate the certificates needed.
How to securely communicate with Vault to get the TLS certificates is out of scope for this post.
Host Configuration Unless you already have Vault running somewhere on your network, or have another mechanism to generate TLS certificates for each machine, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start and configure Vault on the Host machine.</description></item><item><title>Using Vault as a Development CA</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2019/08/25/vault-development-ca/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2019/08/25/vault-development-ca/</guid><description>Often when developing or testing some code, I need (or want) to use SSL, and one of the easiest ways to do that is to use Vault. However, it gets pretty annoying having to generate a new CA for each project, and import the CA cert into windows (less painful in Linux, but still annoying), especially as I forget which cert is in use, and accidentally clean up the wrong ones.</description></item><item><title>Locking Vault Down with Policies</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/06/23/vault-locking-it-down-with-policies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/06/23/vault-locking-it-down-with-policies/</guid><description>The final part of my Vault miniseries focuses on permissioning, which is provided by Vault&amp;rsquo;s Policies.
As everything in Vault is represented as a path, the policies DSL (Domain Specific Language) just needs to apply permissions to paths to lock things down. For example, to allow all operations on the cubbyhole secret engine, we would define this policy:
path &amp;#34;cubbyhole/*&amp;#34; { capabilities = [&amp;#34;create&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;read&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;update&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;delete&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;list&amp;#34;] } Vault comes with a default policy which allows token operations (such as looking up its own token info, releasing and renewing tokens), and cubbyhole access.</description></item><item><title>Secure Communication with Vault</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/06/22/vault-secure-communication/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/06/22/vault-secure-communication/</guid><description>I think Vault by Hashicorp is a great product - I particularly love how you can do dynamic secret generation (e.g for database connections). But how do you validate that the application requesting the secret is allowed to perform that action? How do you know it&amp;rsquo;s not someone or something impersonating your application?
While musing this at an airport the other day, my colleague Patrik sent me a link to a StackOverflow post about this very question</description></item><item><title>Managing Postgres Connection Strings with Vault</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/06/17/secret-management-vault-postgres-connection/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/06/17/secret-management-vault-postgres-connection/</guid><description>One of the points I made in my recent NDC talk on 12 Factor microservices, was that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be storing sensitive data, such as API keys, usernames, passwords etc. in the environment variables.
Don&amp;rsquo;t Store Sensitive Data in the Environment
My reasoning is that when you were accessing Environment Variables in Heroku&amp;rsquo;s platform, you were actually accessing some (probably) secure key-value store, rather than actual environment variables.
While you can use something like Consul&amp;rsquo;s key-value store for this, it&amp;rsquo;s not much better as it still stores all the values in plaintext, and has no auditing or logging.</description></item></channel></rss>
