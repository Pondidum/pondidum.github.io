The problem is that the Consul cluster needs Vault to create the certificates for TLS, which is quite the catch-22. Luckily for us, quite easy to solve:
Start a temporary Vault instance as an intermediate ca Launch Consul cluster, using Vault to generate certificates Destroy temporary Vault instance Start a permanent Vault instance, with Consul as the store Reprovision the Consul cluster with certificates from the new Vault instance There is a repository on Github with all the scripts used, and a few more details on some options.</description></item><item><title>Creating a TLS enabled Consul cluster</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2019/09/14/consul-tls-cluster/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2019/09/14/consul-tls-cluster/</guid><description>This post is going to go through how to set up a Consul cluster to communicate over TLS. I will be using Vagrant to create three machines locally, which will form my cluster, and in the provisioning step will use Vault to generate the certificates needed.
How to securely communicate with Vault to get the TLS certificates is out of scope for this post.
Host Configuration Unless you already have Vault running somewhere on your network, or have another mechanism to generate TLS certificates for each machine, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start and configure Vault on the Host machine.</description></item><item><title>Using Vault as a Development CA</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2019/08/25/vault-development-ca/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2019/08/25/vault-development-ca/</guid><description>Often when developing or testing some code, I need (or want) to use SSL, and one of the easiest ways to do that is to use Vault. However, it gets pretty annoying having to generate a new CA for each project, and import the CA cert into windows (less painful in Linux, but still annoying), especially as I forget which cert is in use, and accidentally clean up the wrong ones.</description></item></channel></rss>
