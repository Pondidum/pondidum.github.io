While doing continuous delivery does change the QA process, when done well, it improves everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives and makes the software better quality. Are silver bullets incoming? Not quite, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have to make someone&amp;rsquo;s life worse to improve other people&amp;rsquo;s lives.</description></item><item><title>Against SemVer</title><link>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/12/16/against-semver/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydote.co.uk/2018/12/16/against-semver/</guid><description>Well, for Applications &amp;amp; Services at least. For libraries, SemVer is the way to go, assuming you can agree on what a breaking change is defined as.
But when it comes to Applications (or SaaS products, websites, etc.) SemVer starts to break down. The problem starts with the most obvious: What is a breaking change? How about a minor change?
What&amp;rsquo;s in a change? For example, if we were to change the UI of a web application, which caused no backend changes, from the user perspective it is probably a breaking change, but not from the developers perspective.</description></item></channel></rss>
