Not only is it significantly faster than Hyper-V was on windows, but it also means I don&amp;rsquo;t need to use Oracle products, so it&amp;rsquo;s win-win really.
The only configuration challenge I have had with it is setting up VM hostname resolution, and as I forget how to do it each time, I figured I should write about it.</description></item></channel></rss>
